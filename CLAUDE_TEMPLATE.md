## Google Workspace Safety

When using Google Workspace tools (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, etc.):
- Always tell me exactly what you're about to do before doing it
- For any action that creates, modifies, or deletes data, ask for my confirmation first
- Show me the specific details (recipient, document name, calendar event, etc.)
